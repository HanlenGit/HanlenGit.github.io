# personal-website
 Re-launched personal website
The first time we worked on HTML and CSS at She Codes it was incredibly overwhelming. None of the information was was making sense and the code looked like it was written in sanskrit. Now 4 months later I am so excited to recreate my website and feel a little bit better about my abilities. Look, color schemes, graphic design it NOT a talent I possess But what I can say it that I like to come up with the vision and have the experts take over from there.
