                    <p class="about-me-text">Kia Ora! Thank you so much for venturing through my website and reading more about me. I am a proud Maori woman from Aotearoa (New Zealand) who migrated to Whadjuk Boodja in 2012.<br><br>
                        I have a Bachelor Degree in Business with a major in Human Resources and Employment Relations. I have 10 years of leadership experience with nine of those years in the employment services space and prior to this I worked for the Ministry of Social Development in New Zealand for nine years. I am passionate about elevating First Nations people into roles where they can influence decisions that affect the future generations.
                        I am an advocate and ally for vulerable individuals and believe that higher education is the key to increased representation in executive roles.<br><br>
                     Current Professional Experience: State Manager - CareerTrackers Indigenous Internship Program is a social enterprise that seeks to increase Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in to Executive and Board appointments. We have 700 students interning nationally in 2021/2022 and over 1000 alumni to our program. In July I will commence a Digital Business Analsyt role with IBM.<br><br>
                    Glober Trotter: My family and I love to travel and before covid (BC) we took our kids on some epic adventures. Trekking in Nepal, backpacking in Rajastan, total immersion in ancient Egypt and touring Turkey which was my favourite place. In Septemner we are venturing to Italy, Croatia, France and England to catch up with friends.<br><br>
                    If I am not at F45 hanging with my friends, I could be kayaking, mountain biking or shuffling around Point Peron with friends. Maintaining my mental and physical health has always been a priority. Although not an athlete by any means, living in WA means that there is a plethora or activities to take advantage of.</p>

                    <p class="project-text">In November 2021, I applied for a place with the She Codes Plus Program. My motivation for submitting my application was to learn a completely foreign skill and do so with other woman in a safe and nurturing environment.
                    I was terrified of being the dumbest person in the class, showing weakness and this fear nearly resulted in withdrawing from the program multiple times.
                    What kept me in the program was the incredible support from mentors, my fellow particpants who have become friends, and that every week a small piece of the puzzle was coming together.
                    Six months later I know that if I can learn the basics of coding and feel comfortable with different programming languages where I look forward to mentoring many more people in the future.
